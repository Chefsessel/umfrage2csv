## What is it? ##

Umfrage2CSV is a small code snippet that takes and writes the user input from a form to a .csv file (not included). It served as a PHP training for me and was used in an intranet survey.

style.css
danke.php
umfrage.php 

Just upload it to your webserver (or your local server with e.g. xampp) and don't forget to create a .csv file. (by default, it saves input in ergebnis.csv )
